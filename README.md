# DemonicStalker

A php app who uses discord slash commands to track parcels made with ```La Poste``` (french mail service) made with [discord-slash-commands](https://github.com/GribouilleVert/discord-slash-commands)

## Developer note:

This project was developed only to experiment with discord slash commands and externals APIs, this project is now **DEPRECATED**.

The code _should_ work if you import the database, and the slash commands as given in the ``slashs-commands.txt`` and in ``demonic-stalker.sql``.
(look here to [register slash-commands](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/slash-commands#registering-a-command))

If you want to re-use this code, please credit the original author or inspiration :)
